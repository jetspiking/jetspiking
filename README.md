### 📕 About Me  

I am Dustin, a Technical-Computer-Science student from the Netherlands. I enjoy building and creating my own applications, along with DIY-projects. I like to share my applications and projects with the world.

I am a Windows Phone, Mac and Linux enthousiast and enjoy impulsively buying awesome (retro) hardware, such as consoles, netbooks, notebooks, phones and other hardware.  I like searching for the limitations of Hardware and Software, and if possible, solve those.
